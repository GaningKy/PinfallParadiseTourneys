## üîß Technical Details

### **Data Structure:**

**Tournament Registration Object:**
```javascript
{
    id: timestamp,
    tournamentId: number,
    userId: number,
    name: string,
    email: string,
    discordName: string,      // New field
    robloxName: string,       // New field
    skillLevel: string,
    registeredAt: ISO timestamp,
    status: 'confirmed'
}
```

**Tournament Object (Updated):**
```javascript
{
    id: timestamp,
    name: string,
    format: string,
    startDate: date,
    registrationDeadline: datetime,  // New field
    maxParticipants: number,
    description: string,
    participants: array,
    registrations: array,            // New field
    bracket: object,
    status: string
}
```

### **Storage:**
- All registrations stored in `localStorage`
- Persists across browser sessions
- Tied to user account via `userId`

### **Validation:**
1. Deadline check - `new Date(deadline) < new Date()`
2. Duplicate check - `tournamentRegistrations.some(reg => reg.tournamentId === id && reg.userId === currentUser.id)`
3. Capacity check - `registrations.length >= maxParticipants`
