## 📋 For Developers: How to Release Updates

### **Step 1: Make Your Changes**
Edit your code as needed (add features, fix bugs, etc.)

### **Step 2: Update Version Number**
In `tournament.js`, find this line near the top:
```javascript
const APP_VERSION = '1.2.0'; // Update this when you make changes
```

Change it to the next version:
```javascript
const APP_VERSION = '1.3.0'; // Your new version
```

### **Step 3: Update Changelog**
In the same file, find the `getUpdateFeatures` function and add your changes:

```javascript
const changeLog = {
    '1.3.0': [  // Add your new version here
        'Feature 1 you added',
        'Feature 2 you added',
        'Bug fix you made'
    ],
    '1.2.0': [
        'Added manual bowler selection for tournaments',
        // ... existing features
    ],
    // ... other versions
};
```

### **Step 4: Deploy**
Upload your updated files to your hosting service:
- GitHub Pages: Push to repository
- Netlify: Drag and drop new files
- Vercel: Git push triggers auto-deploy

### **Step 5: Users Get Notified**
- Next time users visit, they see update modal
- They can update immediately or dismiss
- All their data is preserved
- They resume exactly where they left off
